# Telegram Desktop → Fabushi 全量等价重写 — Status

Spec: TDRP-001 Revision 9  
Parent: FBCP-001 Revision 7  
Complete: false

| Area | Status | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Product role | active | tdesktop is complete source authority, not a runtime/provider |
| Discovery upstream | observed | `f23c37857220eb84f8559f0901ea26fb304b564b`; not yet accepted baseline |
| Historical baseline | stale | `33261535a0e747f125e0ed25486f01e556330677`; evidence cannot be inherited |
| Recursive source closure | rebaseline required | current lock/inventory must be reconciled to one exact upstream baseline |
| File-level inventory | not accepted | must reach unknown=0, unread=0, omitted=0 |
| Responsibility decomposition | not accepted | every source symbol/responsibility requires traceable destination |
| Exact-head owner inventory | in progress | existing-owner-first remains mandatory |
| UI composition / IA | in progress | one shell, one Conversation/Search/Profile/Marketplace truth |
| Design-system migration | in progress | new migrated UI must use Fabushi semantic tokens/components |
| Native service completeness | in progress / blocked where absent | blocked service is not functional acceptance |
| Production implementation | partial | existing slices do not imply full migration |
| Existing Bot regression | required | Agent/Host/Coordinator/Runner/Plugins/MCP/Computer/Automations/Tasks etc. must remain green |
| Quality/RTM gates | not fully implemented | Revision 9 schema/validator fields and traceability still require executable gates |
| Packaged acceptance | fail-closed required | acceptance failure must block release |
| Independent release acceptance | not accepted | final verdict must be ACCEPT |

## Current live reconciliation

On 2026-10-07, `main` was observed at `e0a7a4221970088beeaf145d0d9be1763e58229f`. That commit weakened the real signed packaged acceptance step with `continue-on-error: true`, which conflicted with FBCP Revision 7 / TDRP Revision 9. The regression was removed on `main` by commit `2115a91eb888aa65702ef8f90f01848042bb65c7`.

This status file records only observed repository state. It is not completion evidence. Any newer `main` supersedes these SHAs and must be re-read before implementation or acceptance.

## Metrics

Report separately:
- accepted upstream baseline completeness;
- source file read coverage;
- responsibility understanding coverage;
- existing-owner resolution coverage;
- production implementation coverage;
- exact-head test/evidence coverage;
- packaged temporal acceptance;
- independent release acceptance.

Do not report Telegram-provider, Telegram-network, survey, document count, or vertical-slice progress as migration completion.


### cf478d37 live-authority rebaseline

Live Revision 9 authority (2026-10-10): telegramdesktop/tdesktop@cf478d37c8f57df831cdedb5621e1cf2ef069a0f (root tree fa901c0c44fb1f94fd38de0d5edbcfef23a9f0ad). Root non-directory=6,653; recursive non-directory=16,125; read-through=5,793; first unread=5,794 Telegram/SourceFiles/test/test_log.cpp@17c72a8ae1bc672e7c380b855887b859b78fabec; unread=10,332; unknown=15,846; omitted=0. Changed accepted-prefix orders 11/30/31/92/4599/5759/5764/5765 were explicitly re-read; lib_ui is now order 6,589; runs 37958691718/37958689647 and artifacts 11630066443/11631221092/11630211787 are historical-only for 863cf10d9f34fb0b1b35b35da1bda75acfc58d2e + b4d9f7f8cf580eefd553c5ce105f1d3e682de87f.

Direct delta: channel_earn.style replaces static negative placeholder margins with floating placeholderShiftLeft; lib_ui 91ff446 implements horizontal interpolation in InputField and MaskedInputField. Canonical TextField remains the sole product owner. Orders 5,774-5,793 were identity/order reconciled; reading alone closes no unknown.


### Revision 9 live read-through note: 5794-5801

Orders 5,794-5,797 preserve professional evidence-log one-line/completion-forgery integrity plus an independent raw-byte oracle. Orders 5,798-5,799 preserve complete mapped-target/viewport capture readiness. Orders 5,800-5,801 preserve the bounded reversible not-marking-read evidence lever. These are test/evidence responsibilities only, create no second product owner, and close no unknown. The new 811b83a1 readability delta is order 5,951 and remains unread/unknown.


### Revision 9 live read-through note: 5802-5805

Orders 5,802-5,803 close the exact-blob read/decomposition of popup/context-menu professional evidence semantics: same-turn fresh-menu identity, explicit refusal taxonomy, isolated QAction queued-callback delivery, prepared-frame capture and lock/teardown behavior. Orders 5,804-5,805 close the SentMessageWatcher client→server id reconciliation contract with stable-history/candidate fencing and a five-second diagnostic probe throttle. These are test/evidence responsibilities only and close no unknown. First unread is now 5,806 `test_notify_override.cpp`.
