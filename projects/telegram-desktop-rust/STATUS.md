# Telegram Desktop → Fabushi 全量等价重写 — Status

Date: 2026-10-07  
Spec: TDRP-001 Revision 9  
Parent: FBCP-001 Revision 7  
Complete: false

| Area | Status | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Product role | active | tdesktop is complete source authority, not a runtime/provider |
| Discovery upstream | observed | `f23c37857220eb84f8559f0901ea26fb304b564b`; not yet accepted baseline |
| Historical baseline | stale | `33261535a0e747f125e0ed25486f01e556330677`; evidence cannot be inherited |
| Recursive source closure | rebaseline required | current lock/inventory must be reconciled to one exact upstream baseline |
| File-level inventory | not accepted | must reach unknown=0, unread=0, omitted=0 |
| Responsibility decomposition | not accepted | every source symbol/responsibility requires traceable destination |
| Exact-head owner inventory | in progress | existing-owner-first remains mandatory |
| UI composition / IA | in progress | one shell, one Conversation/Search/Profile/Marketplace truth |
| Design-system migration | in progress | new migrated UI must use Fabushi semantic tokens/components |
| Native service completeness | in progress / blocked where absent | blocked service is not functional acceptance |
| Production implementation | partial | existing slices do not imply full migration |
| Existing Bot regression | required | Agent/Host/Coordinator/Runner/Plugins/MCP/Computer/Automations/Tasks etc. must remain green |
| Quality/RTM gates | not fully implemented | Revision 9 schema/validator fields and traceability still require executable gates |
| Packaged acceptance | fail-closed required | acceptance failure must block release |
| Independent release acceptance | not accepted | final verdict must be ACCEPT |

## Current live reconciliation

On 2026-10-07, `main` was observed at `e0a7a4221970088beeaf145d0d9be1763e58229f`. That commit weakened the real signed packaged acceptance step with `continue-on-error: true`, which conflicted with FBCP Revision 7 / TDRP Revision 9. The regression was removed on `main` by commit `2115a91eb888aa65702ef8f90f01848042bb65c7`.

This status file records only observed repository state. It is not completion evidence. Any newer `main` supersedes these SHAs and must be re-read before implementation or acceptance.

## Metrics

Report separately:
- accepted upstream baseline completeness;
- source file read coverage;
- responsibility understanding coverage;
- existing-owner resolution coverage;
- production implementation coverage;
- exact-head test/evidence coverage;
- packaged temporal acceptance;
- independent release acceptance.

Do not report Telegram-provider, Telegram-network, survey, document count, or vertical-slice progress as migration completion.
